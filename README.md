# RaidCC
A WotLK 3.3.5a addon for Stormforge-Netherwing to show the CC any raid member uses and the time remaining.

It creates a movable frame with the list of timers for all the CC the raid/party casts. The bars include a raid target icon to the left, if one is set for the target.  When the CC is removed/broken, a message is added to the chat frame telling you the raid target icon, who cast the CC, which spell it was and that it is up.
